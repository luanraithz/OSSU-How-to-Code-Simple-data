## Here are some usefull links that I used in this repository:
* [racket docs](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/index.html)

* Racket is a dialect of Lisp and descendant of Scheme;
* We use Racket usually to refer to a set of tools, that are:
    * racket, the core compiler, interpreter, and run-time system;
    * DrRacket, the programming enviroment;
    * raco, a command line tool for executing RAcket COmmands that install packages, build libraries and more.
